            <h4>Incentive plan</h4>
            <br>
            <div class="col s12 m12 l12">
                <p>
                    We have developed a comprehensive <b>network marketing incentive programwhich</b> uses a <b>3X10
                        matrix</b> to
                    incentivise marketers. Before you take part in the marketing program, it is important for you to
                    read the <b>Terms and Conditions</b>(read them here) affecting your involvement in the program. If
                    you
                    are
                    satisfied with the information given in the Terms and Conditions, it is critical for you to accept
                    them for the system to allow you to proceed. When you sign up to register as an iGen donor, you will
                    have to choose <b>Option 3</b> if you prefer to participate in the incentive program.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With our 3X10 matrix, we are able to incentivise you on a monthly basis for actively or passively
                    marketing The iGen
                    Education Trust to family, friends and any other person you may think of. Once any of the people you
                    have marketed iGen
                    to decides to donate to iGen on a monthly basis, we will reward you for using your time and effort
                    to
                    support the iGen
                    dream. <b> The 3X10 matrix simply means you are allowed a maximum of three people directly under you
                        but
                        you
                        will be
                        incentivised up to ten levels deep.</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is important at this stage for you to remember that this whole iGen concept is about raising
                    funds to support tertiary students who are financially needy so they could honour their financial
                    commitments to their institutions. Therefore, regardless of the immense possibilities which exist
                    for you to generate huge revenue, <b> do not allow yourself to be motivated and driven by
                        uncontrollable
                        greed.</b>
                </p>
                <p>The sections below fully explain how our 3X10 matrix works. Please, study it carefully to develop a
                    full understanding and to appreciate the comprehensive algorithms used to achieve this.
                </p>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col s12 m12 l12">
                <h5>Level 1</h5>
                <p>With the 3X10 matrix, our system will allow you to have a <b>maximum of three (3)</b> people directly
                    referred by you. These people will be referred to as your direct downlines as they will be directly
                    linked to you in our incentive matrix (see illustration in the Figure below).</p>
                <br>
                <img src="" alt="">
                <p>
                    The illustration above shows a direct link between you, Thando, Nosie and Morné . This means that
                    you would have personally marketed and promoted iGen to Thando, Nosie and Morné and they would have
                    used your member ID (MID) during their registration phase when upline details were requested. These
                    three people directly connected to you are also referred as your first level or <b>Level one
                        (1).</b> You
                    will be paid monthly by Expansior for each donor you refer who decides to make a monthly donation to
                    iGen. You don’t have to fill any level fully for you to be incentivised. You will be paid according
                    to the number of people in your network regardless of whether all positions on a certain level are
                    fully occupied or not. Your incentive will vary depending on the amount contributed by each donor in
                    your team/network. However, it is important to note that each person can only have a maximum of
                    three people directly linked to him/her.

                </p>

                <h5>Level 2</h5>

                <p>The network marketing programme allows those below you to also refer three donors under each one of
                    them. This simply means that, using the illustration above, Thando can also refer three people who
                    will be directly under him. Nosie and Morné also have an equal opportunity to do the same and market
                    iGen to three other people each (see illustration below). This means each of them will end up with
                    three people under them, making a total of nine people for that level.
                </p>

                This is referred to as your <b>Level 2</b>, but it will be level one for Thando, Nosie and Morne.
                Just like
                you, the three will be incentivised on a monthly basis for their referrals. However, since you
                personally referred Thando, Nosie and Morné, the system will still pay you the same amount you received
                earlier per person for the nine people referred by the people under you. This is because the system
                acknowledges that you are their <b>indirect upline</b> (see digram below). The system only allows you a
                <b>maximum
                    of nine (9) people on level two.</b>
                <br>
                <img src="" alt="">

                <p>The system will pay you on the basis of a number of factors, i.e. the amount you are donating to iGen
                    on a monthly basis, the amount donated to iGen by each of your downlines on a monthly basis, the
                    number of active downlines you have in your team and the reduction formula used from level six to
                    level ten as indicated in the terms and conditions (read your terms and conditions here).
                    <br>
                    Due to the fact that there are seven different monthly donation options to choose from, i.e. R100,
                    R300, R500, R800, R1,500, R3,000 and R5,000, the incentive you are going to receive will vary
                    depending on the combination of the factors mentioned above. The system has been designed to create
                    an <b>accurate set of rules</b> to be followed in calculating these amounts. It takes all these
                    factors
                    into account and calculates the total amount to be paid into your account on a monthly basis. Unless
                    you are contributing R100 and every other person in your network donates the same amount, it becomes
                    literally impossible to estimate the amount you are likely to receive at the end of each month,
                    until the actual time comes.
                    <br>
                    Several sections below use the <b>assumption that every person in your network is contributing the
                        same
                        amount</b> as yours for the donation options listed above. When such an assumption is made, it
                    becomes
                    possible to estimate the likely incentive to be paid to you and other marketers in your team.
                </p>

                <h5>Spill-overs</h5>
                <p>
                    Due to the nature of the matrix, it is almost certain that members will receive <b>spill-overs</b>
                    from
                    their
                    uplines, Spill-overs happen when those above you refer more people who sign up to donate than the
                    three
                    (3) that they are expected to. That then leads to you receiving marketers under you who will belong
                    to
                    your network even though you never personally marketed to them. This maximises the amazing power of
                    <b>leverage</b> and helps to grow your team, and inevitably your incentive, phenomenally. It,
                    therefore,
                    means
                    you don’t only benefit from your own efforts and the efforts of those below you, but you also
                    benefit
                    from the hard work of those above you. This is teamwork, or rather <b>ubuntu</b>, at its best. This
                    is
                    illustrated in the diagram below.
                </p>

                <img src="" alt="">
                <p>
                    In the diagram above, all the red individuals are spill-overs from uplines of the different
                    marketers. Person 1 only successfully marketed iGen to person 4, but he also received persons 9 and
                    10 from you as his upline. This simply means that you, as the upline, referred more people than the
                    3 expected on your level 1. This will continue for as long as those above you keep referring people
                    who end up registering to support iGen.
                    <br>
                    This practically means you will be able to earn revenue from the referral fees of people you have
                    not personally referred, and highly likely people you do not know but who were successfully referred
                    to iGen by your different uplines.
                    <br>

                    This makes the 3X10 matrix a <b>“communal matrix”</b> or an <b>“ubuntu matrix”</b> which promotes
                    the
                    power
                    of
                    collective effort while maximising the benefits of individual profitability.
                    <br>
                    Each donation option carries its own incentive amount, with R100 per month carrying the lowest and
                    R5000 per month carrying the highest. The amount you choose to donate determines the level at which
                    you will be incentivised. If you choose to donate a lower amount, i.e. R100 pm, you will be
                    incentivised as per the R100 option. If you choose to donate a higher amount, i.e. R5000 pm, you
                    will be incentivised far much more per person, depending on the donation level of each person in
                    your team.

                <p>
                    The amounts paid per person per month may seem rather small to you and many other people, but if you
                    consider the fact that your team grows from communal effort and not individual effort, you will
                    appreciate the power behind this strategy. Many network marketing companies tend to focus more on
                    the power and ability of individual network marketers to recruit and keep other marketers. Such
                    companies tend to pay reasonably huge commissions on a monthly basis, but they fail to realise two
                    very important factors, i.e. 1) that not every person out there is a network marketer who is adept
                    at recruiting, and 2) that an individual’s efforts can only benefit him or her so much in a day.
                    <b>Our
                        3X10 ubuntu matrix maximises the benefits of collective team effort</b> and very few network
                    marketing
                    matrices can successfully yield the results it produces.

                <h4>Incentive calculation for The Floe - R100 donation</h4>
                <p>For the R100.00 donation option, you will be paid <b>R3.04 per person per month</b> from level one to
                    five
                    for each person who is in your network, regardless of the amount contributed by your downlines or
                    the amount contributed by any of the spill-overs. <b>Your remuneration is determined by the amount
                        you
                        donate.</b> See below for a table (only levels 1-5) indicating what you are likely to receive,
                    assuming
                    each person in your network will be contributing R100.00 per month. The calculation would be
                    straightforward if the amounts remained at R100.00 throughout the donation period. However, that is
                    less likely to happen as amounts will continuously vary due to the individual amounts which members
                    of your team may choose to donate as well as the built-in automatic upgrade facility.</p>

                            proof that

                <h4>Incentive calculation for The Sirius - R5000 donation</h4>
                <p>For the R5,000.00 donation option, you will be paid <b> R152.00 per person per month </b>from level
                    one to five for each person who is in your network, regardless of the amount contributed by your
                    downlines or the amount contributed by any of the spill-overs.<b> Your remuneration is determined
                        by the
                        amount
                        you
                        donate.</b>See below for a table (only levels 1-5) indicating what you are likely to receive,
                    assuming each person in your network will be contributing R5,000.00 per month. The calculation
                    would be straightforward if the amounts remained at R5,000.00 throughout the donation period.
                    However, that is less likely to happen as amounts will continuously vary due to the individual
                    amounts which members of your team may choose to donate as well as the built-in automatic
                    upgrade facility.</p>

                    <p>The 3X10 matrix of The Sirius (shown up to level 5 only)
                        <br><br>
                        For every R5,000.00 amount contributed by each donor to iGen, R950.00 will be set aside for
                        marketing. 20% of the R950, i.e. R190.00 will be set aside for the running of the marketing
                        company and 80% of the R950.00, i.e, R760.00 will be set aside for the compensation of
                        marketers. All marketers who successfully encourage other people to donate to iGen will be
                        incentivised using a 3X10 matrix as partially indicated in the table below.

                    <p>
                        As you can evidently see from the table above, the incentive program already pays you more than
                        your
                        donation amount by the time you complete level 3, or by the time you have 39 marketers in your
                        team.
                        By the time you reach the end of level 5, the program will be incentivising you with an amount
                        which
                        is more than ten times the amount you are donating to iGen. Simply put, a R5,000 donation to
                        iGen on a
                        monthly basis has the potential to help you generate over R50,000 per month through the
                        Expansior
                        incentive program. <b>This is indeed incontrovertible
                            proof that
