                <h4>INTRODUCING EXPANSIOR</h4>
                <p>Expansior is a network marketing organisation established to address human needs in meaningful ways.
                    We enable people to achieve personal goals and dreams while contributing MASSIVELY to social and
                    economic change.</p>
                <p>Our VISION is to build a tremendously successful group of companies with a global foot-print,
                    serving the South African nation in distinctive, significant, life changing ways that will
                    accelerate social and economic development. </p>
                <p>We believe in the power of education to transform society, reduce inequality and eradicate poverty.
                    For this reason,
                    our first mission is to address access to higher education. We do this by marketing and raising
                    funds for iGen Education Trust.
                    <a href="http://www.igenedutrust.org.za/" target="_blank">www.igenedutrust.org.za</a></p>

                <p>While the core of our business activities rests in South&nbsp;Africa, we plan to have considerable
                    presence in the rest of Africa, followed by markets in Asia, the Americas, Caribbean Islands,
                    Europe and Australia. Our desire to spread our wings to global markets is driven by the increasing
                    poverty and growing inequality among members of society across the world.</p>

                <p>We are fully persuaded that by harnessing the power of network marketing, we can impact destinies.
                    EXPANSIOR IS NOT JUST A BUSINESS, WE ARE <b style="font-weight: 900; color: black">NATION BUILDERS.</b></p>
