                    <h4>Hold on, this sounds like a pyramid scheme to me…</h4><br>
                    <p>Expansior is built on the concept of Network Marketing (NM), also known as Multi-Level
                        Marketing (MLM).
                        This is a smartly designed system used by companies all over the world, to maximise the
                        marketing and distribution of their products and/or services.
                        These could be tangible or intangible products/services. This means that a legitimate
                        business using the NM/MLM as a distribution system for its products or services will
                        use independent individuals (marketers) to market and sell their products/services to
                        the public. This is often done via direct sales or word of mouth.
                        The independent marketers are paid a commission from the sale of the product/service
                        and are also compensated for sales made by the marketers which they recruited.
                        The payment plan in NW/MLM is designed such that commission is paid to different
                        marketers at multiple levels after a single sale is made.

                            Pyramid schemes on the other hand are, fraudulent schemes, usually deliberately disguised as
                            a NM strategy. They often do not sell any meaningful product or service but merely collect
                            money with the promise of massive returns after a few months. Those involved are then
                            encouraged to go and recruit more people who in turn are encouraged to “invest’ more money
                            without any logical explanation of how their money grows or where it comes from. Pyramid
                            schemes also tend to promise high and unrealistic returns in a short period of time for
                            doing close to nothing other than “investing” money and getting others to do the same. The
                            reward for recruiting new members or investors is almost always more than it is for selling
                            the actual product/service to members of the public. In all pyramid schemes, it is not
                            possible to make more money than the person who recruited you, however hard you work.

                            Most, if not all, pyramid schemes are illegitimate operations and therefore illegal as they
                            normally don’t register with the relevant authorities or seek the necessary licenses
                            authorising them to conduct their businesses. In most cases, nobody knows who the owner of
                            the scheme is and the address used is normally not even linked to the “company” itself.
